    <h2>Myungwon Ethan Lee</h2>
    <p>Hi! My Korean name is Myungwon, but I just go by Ethan as you can tell it's quite hard to pronounce my name.</p>
    <p>I'm from South Korea, about an hour away from Seoul. I'm the youngest of 4 children, and I enjoy playing sports and going
        to the gym.</p>
    <p>Befor I came to BYU-Idaho, I served a mission in New York City, and also served in the military in Korea for a year and a
        half. </p>
    <p>My major is Software Engineering and this is my first semester! So I'm still trying to figure out what I
        specifically want for my career. I'm excited to learn from this school!</p>
