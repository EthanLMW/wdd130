        Purpose
        - Students are always looking for a place that is comfortable, convenient, and affordable. They will be
        searching on the internet to find one that meets their needs the most. From our experiences, when we go on the
        websites of other apartments, it is very difficult to get all the information I want quickly. We often had to
        look through every small thing to find them, and it took too much time to figure out what is where. Your search
        to find the apartment you want brought you to the perfect place. You will find it intriguing as you explore our
        site because it is designed for students to provide information which most students are looking for. In
        addition, you will be able to search and know about our apartments easily and quickly. Our website will be
        simple enough for students to have an easy access to all that we have to offer.
        
        Floorplan
        - One of the most important part of a housing is about how comfortable and convenient the students feel in the apartment. At RI Aparments, students will be able to feel like being at home. Our apartments are designed just to provide the best environment for you. With all that we have in apartments, you will  be able to focus on academics. As a BYU-Idaho approved housing and in association with BYU-Idaho, we promote the Student Living Standards and encourage students to live by them.
        
        Amenities
        - We offer a variety of amenities for you to have a more enjoyable experience at our apartment. You can mingle
        with your friends at our clubhouse, exercise in the fitness center, or study at the study room when you want a
        quiet environment to study.
