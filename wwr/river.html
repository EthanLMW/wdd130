                    Salmon River, Idaho
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Salmon River, also known as "The River of No Return", is a river located in the U.S. state of Idaho in the western United States. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left. It flows for 425 miles through central Idaho. The river drops more than 7,000 feet from its headwaters, near Galena Summit above the Sawtooth Valley in the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, to its confluence with the Snake River. It is one of the largest rivers in the continental United States without a single dam on its mainstem.

                    <p>
                        The Salmon River is most massive river in Idaho and one of the largest in North America, the Salmon wends its way through the second deepest canyon on the continent. It passes through 85 miles of remote wilderness, and is a world-renown river adventure, offering one a unique chance to disconnect from civilization and become immersed in a virtually untouched natural wonder.
                        Picturesque Stanley, nestled in the crook of the Salmon River with the backdrop of the striking Sawtooth Mountains, is one of the most scenic small towns in the USA. Moreover, Redfish Lake framed by the dramatic jagged Sawtooth mountain range and surrounded by pine tree forested banks will leave you in awe.

                    Wildlife
                </h3>
                <p>
                    With areas seldom touched by humans, the Salmon River basin provides outstanding habitat for wildlife, including black bear, bighorn sheep, mountain lion, elk, gray wolf, Canada lynx, sage grouse, moose, deer and wolverine. And you have to count orcas on any list of Salmon River wildlife; they depend so heavily on salmon that their very survival hinges on plentiful runs of Salmon/Snake River Chinook. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.

                    Let's not forget the rapids!
                    They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer... but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water
                    more.
